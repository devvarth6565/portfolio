# Feature Update: Nested Project Windows & Media Player

The Desktop and Main Windows are working perfectly. Now, we need to implement the specific **Project Drill-Down** functionality.

## The Interaction Flow
1.  **Level 1:** User double-clicks "My Documents" (Projects) icon on Desktop.
    * **Action:** Opens the `ProjectsExplorer` window.
    * **Content:** Displays a grid of folders (e.g., "AI Persona", "Ecommerce App").
2.  **Level 2:** User double-clicks a specific **Project Folder** inside that window.
    * **Action:** Triggers the `WindowManager` to open a NEW, separate window layered *on top* of the Explorer.
    * **New Window Title:** The name of the project (e.g., "AI Persona - Preview").
    * **Content:** This new window must contain the **Windows Media Player** component.

## Component Specifications

### 1. The `ProjectDetailWindow` (The Media Player)
Create a new component that mimics **Windows Media Player 9 (WMP9)**.
* **Visual Style:**
    * Background: Dark grey/black for the video area.
    * Controls Area: Silver gradient bottom bar.
    * Buttons: Circular "Play/Pause" button in the center, smaller "Stop" and "Volume" buttons.
    * Seeker Bar: A thin blue progress bar.
* **Functionality:**
    * It must receive a `videoSrc` prop.
    * Use the standard HTML5 `<video>` tag but hide the default browser controls.
    * Build *custom* React buttons that control the video (Play, Pause, Mute).

### 2. Update `WindowManager` Logic
Update the `openWindow` function to accept a `payload` or `props` object.
* *Current:* `openWindow('projects')`
* *New:* `openWindow('project-detail', { projectId: 1, videoSrc: '/project_video.mp4' })`

### 3. Update `ProjectsExplorer`
* Map through a list of projects.
* On double-click of a folder, call:
    `openWindow('project_detail', { title: project.title, video: project.videoUrl })`

## Asset Requirement
* Assume the user has uploaded a video file named `project_video.mp4` in the public folder.
* Use this file as the default source for the video player.

**Task:** Write the code for the `MediaWindow` component and the updated `WindowManager` logic to support this "Window-inside-a-Window" flow.
